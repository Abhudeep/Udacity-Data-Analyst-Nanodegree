# üåü Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree 

Focus area: Data analysis using Python.

Completion: March 2023

At the end of the course, these are my üîë **key learnings**:
- Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data, and work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
- Apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.
- Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data and use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.
- Apply visualization principles to the data analysis process and explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.

## Part 2: Introduction to Data Analysis

### üç∑ [Case Study #1 Wine Quality](https://github.com/Abhudeep/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Udacity%20Project%20Wine%20quality.ipynb)

A study on red and white wine samples and understanding whether certain types of wine and their qualities (alcohol
level, sugar content and acidity level) are associated with higher wine quality

### üé¨ [Project #2 TMDb Movie Analysis](https://github.com/Abhudeep/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Udacity%20Project2-%20Kaggle-Movie%20Dataset%20.ipynb)

Analysing more than 10,000 TMDb movies and getting the answers to 
- Does having a higher popularity associated with a higher revenue and budget?
- Does having a higher popularity results in a higher profitability?
- Which are the top 10 profitable movies?
- Which are the top 10 Genres?
- How has profitability moved year on year?

## Part 3: Practical Statistics

### [Project #3 Analyze A/B Test Results](https://github.com/Abhudeep/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook-Copy1.ipynb)
For this project, worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Goal is to work through the notebook to help the company understand if they should:
- Implement the new webpage,
- Keep the old webpage, or
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Part 4: Data Wrangling
Discovered insights by cleaning data, Storing data, analyzing and visualizing data of twitter.
### [Project #4 Wrangle and Analyze Data](https://github.com/Abhudeep/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Wrangle%20and%20Analyze%20Data%20-%20WeRateDogs.ipynb)

## Part 5: Data Visualization
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.
- In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
- In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
