# 🌟 Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree 

Focus area: Data analysis using Python.

Completion: March 2023

At the end of the course, these are my 🔑 **key learnings**:
- Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data, and work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
- Apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.
- Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data and use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.
- Apply visualization principles to the data analysis process and explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.

## Part 2: Introduction to Data Analysis

### 🍷 [Case Study #1 Wine Quality](https://github.com/Abhudeep/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Udacity%20Project%20Wine%20quality.ipynb)

A study on red and white wine samples and understanding whether certain types of wine and their qualities (alcohol
level, sugar content and acidity level) are associated with higher wine quality

### 🎬 [Project #2 TMDb Movie Analysis](https://github.com/Abhudeep/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Udacity%20Project2-%20Kaggle-Movie%20Dataset%20.ipynb)

Analysing more than 10,000 TMDb movies and getting the answers to 
- Does having a higher popularity associated with a higher revenue and budget?
- Does having a higher popularity results in a higher profitability?
- Which are the top 10 profitable movies?
- Which are the top 10 Genres?
- How has profitability moved year on year?

## Part 3: Practical Statistics

### [Project #3 Analyze A/B Test Results](https://github.com/Abhudeep/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook-Copy1.ipynb)
For this project, worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Goal is to work through the notebook to help the company understand if they should:
- Implement the new webpage,
- Keep the old webpage, or
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
